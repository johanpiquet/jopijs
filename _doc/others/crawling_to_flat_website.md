# Crawling a website

If you want to transform your site into a static website, Jopi offers a very simple solution
consisting of using a crawler to transform your site into a static relocatable website.

The sites generated by the crawler have two characteristics:
* They are relocatable, meaning they are not attached to a URL.
* They use relative URLs, so you can view HTML files directly from the hard drive without a server.

This second point is particularly interesting, for example for generating a static documentation site.

# Create a crawler

Jopi provides an intermediate API to access the crawler to keep things very simple.

**File index.ts**
```typescript
import {jopiApp} from "jopijs";

jopiApp.startApp(import.meta, jopiEasy => {
    // The website to download.
    jopiEasy.create_webSiteDownloader("https://developer.mozilla.org")
        // Where to store.
        .set_outputDir("./temp/mozilla")
        // Begin the task.
        .START_DOWNLOAD();
});
```

Once executed, you will obtain a local copy of the Mozilla documentation site.

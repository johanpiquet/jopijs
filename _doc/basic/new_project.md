# Start a new project

Starting a new project is very quick with Jopi, thanks to a tool named `jopi` that allows installing a template from a list of starter projects.

**Shell command to select and install a starter project**
```
npx jopi init
```

**Equivalent with bun.js**
```
bunx jopi init
```

> Prerequisite: here you will only need a recent version of node.js (v24.11 minimum) and optionally a recent version of bun.js (v1.3 minimum).
